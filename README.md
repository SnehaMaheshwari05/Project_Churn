# 📊 Telecom Customer Churn Analysis  

## 🔹 Introduction  
Customer churn is one of the biggest challenges in the telecom industry where competition is intense and switching costs are minimal.  
This project aims to **predict churn and uncover patterns behind customer attrition**, helping businesses take smarter decisions to retain users.  

---

## 🔹 Project Overview  
The goal of this project is to:  
- Predict customer churn in a telecom dataset  
- Derive **actionable strategies** to improve customer retention  
- Build **interactive dashboards** that simplify decision-making for business teams  

Special enhancements included:  
✅ Tooltips (e.g., churn reason tooltip on “Churn Rate by Internet Type”)  
✅ Page Navigation Buttons (to switch between multiple report views)  
✅ Custom Columns & Measures in Power BI  
✅ Data type handling and schema adjustments in SQL Server

## 🔹 Tools & Technologies  
- **SQL Server** → schema corrections, data type changes & data loading  
- **Python (Jupyter Notebook)** → exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- **Power BI** → interactive dashboards, tooltips & navigation buttons  
- **Excel** → initial data preprocessing  

---

## 🔹 Workflow / Steps  
1. **Data Preparation** – Cleaned dataset, handled missing values, and standardized data types in SQL Server  
2. **Data Transformation** – Added calculated columns & DAX measures in Power BI  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Used Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) to study churn patterns  
4. **Dashboard Building** – Designed multi-page interactive Power BI dashboards with tooltips & navigation  
5. **Insights & Strategy** – Identified customer groups with higher churn probability and recommended retention strategies  

---

## 🔹 Key Insights  
- Customers with **month-to-month contracts** had a significantly higher churn rate  
- **Fiber optic internet users** showed more churn compared to DSL users  
- **Senior citizens and single-line customers** were more likely to leave  
- **Tooltips** helped stakeholders quickly understand churn reasons without navigating away  

---

## 🔹 Conclusion  
This project demonstrates how an end-to-end analytics pipeline (SQL → Python → Power BI) can be used to solve real-world churn problems.  
With interactive dashboards and actionable insights, telecom companies can proactively design **customer retention strategies**.
